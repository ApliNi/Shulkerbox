# Shulkerbox
 Minecraft/Spigot plugin to streamline inventory management

Features:
- Right click on an ender chest in your inventory to open your ender chest
- Right clicking again closes your ender chest
- Right click on a shulker box in your inventory OR in your ender chest to open it

Anti duplication measures against:
- Dropping the shulker box
- Moving it around
- Dying for any reason
- Disconnecting for any reason

After these measures I have not been able to find any duplication exploits yet after trying every trick I could think of

If you find any duplication bugs please immediately report them [here](https://github.com/percyqaz/Shulkerbox/issues)

Future features and known issues:
- Issue: Doesn't work in the creative inventory. If this matters to you that's very unfortunate as this is written for a private survival server
- Issue: You can put your ender chest into you ender chest and lose it if you only had one. Try not to do that
- Feature: Right click crafting table to craft
- Feature: Config to make it Shift-right-click instead
- Feature: Config to toggle on/off shulker and ender chest behaviour
